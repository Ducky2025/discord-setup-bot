In Termux, make sure you are in your project directory (~/downloads or wherever setup_bot.py is).
Run this command to automatically create the requirements.txt file based on the libraries you installed:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Bash
(This might list more libraries than just discord.py and python-dotenv if you've installed other things globally, which is usually fine).
Now, add this new file to Git and push it to GitHub:
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"
git push origin main # Or 'master' if that's your branch name
Bash
